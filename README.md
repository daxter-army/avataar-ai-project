## 🏎️ STATUS

  - [x] Carousel (Infinite & Finite)

## 📜 NOTES

1. I have tried to follow the convention as per the design system (from the figma file) as much as possible, using the same **variable names as used in the figma file, to mitigate the design and development differences**.
2. **SCSS implementation:** **Variables**, **Mixins** have been used to encourage code reuse.
3. **Rem Units:** I have used **rem** instead of **px**, which is very helpful incase of responsive websites. However this website is not responsive (as per the assignment, funtionalities are implemented but not complete mobile layout as there were only desktop designs).
4. **Atomic design pattern:** Implemented Atomic design pattern, consisting React Components as **atoms**, **molecules**, **organims**. (templates and pages not used since this project only included single page).
5. **HOCs, Hooks, Context:** Common and reuseable logic is situated inside these directories as per react conventions. I have tried to create more and more reusable logic.
6. **Carousel Type:** The Carousel has been displayed in 2 forms, which can be changed with the help of a button.
7. **Enums:** All the constants used in the project are coming from **STATICS** object stored in **src/enums.js**.
8. **Prettier Integration:** Prettier has been integrated in this project to keep uniformed formatting throughout the files.
9. **Commit History:** Tried to commit code in atomic commits.
